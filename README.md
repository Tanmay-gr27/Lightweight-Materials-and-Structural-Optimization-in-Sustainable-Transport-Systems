**Project Title**: Lightweight Materials and Structural Optimization in Sustainable Transport Systems

**Description**:
This project is an in-depth research synthesis developed by **Tanmay G R**, a B.Tech (Electronics and Communication Engineering) student at **Dayananda Sagar University**.

It systematically explores the engineering strategies essential for creating **sustainable and energy-efficient transport**. 
The core focus is on the deployment of advanced **lightweight materials** (such as Aluminum alloys and Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymers) and powerful **structural optimization** techniques (like Topology Optimization) to reduce mass without compromising safety. The analysis covers material properties, computational design methods, and ongoing innovations, and addresses the critical technical and environmental challenges related to **cost, scalability, and material recycling**.
